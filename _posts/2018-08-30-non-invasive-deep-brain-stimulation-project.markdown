# Non-Invasive Deep Brain Stimulation

This repository contains all the code used for simulation of non-invasive Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) via Temporal Interference (TI).

## About the project

The project is inspired by a paper published on June 2017 [1], which proposed a new
method for Non-invasive DBS via two (or more) temporally interfering signals. Using the
codes available in this repo, one can visualize the distribution of electric fields (E-field) in
a spherical head model. Furthermore, using the computed electric field distribution, we
can also see the response of neurons at any point in the conductive medium (head model).
