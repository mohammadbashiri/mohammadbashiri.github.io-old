## Population Coding of Conditional Probability Distributions in Dorsal Premotor Cortex

Today I presented a new paper at Franklin Lab (Sport department, Technical University of Munich) about a paper ([link]) recently publish by <a href="http://kordinglab.com/">KordingLab</a> in Nature Communication.

The authors of the paper are Joshua I. Glaser, Matthew G. Perich, Pavan Ramkumar, Lee E. Miller & Konrad P. Kording

### A short summary of the paper:

In day-to-day motor movements, we are always constrained by the physics of our body as well as the environment which in turn limits the numebr of possible movements that we can perform. In other words, considering the state of our body in the world, some movements may be more probable than others. The result is essentially a probability distribution over possible movements. The question is How does the brain represent these probability distributions?

More specifically we are interested in the followings:

- How does such distribution effect the behavioral performance
- If the probability of possible upcoming movements effect our behavior, how is that information encoded on the neural level?
- Where in the cortex such neurons exist? (primary motor cortex versions dorsal premotor cortex)
- Single neuron versus population coding of the probability distirbution
- is the confidence in the upcoming target, position dependent (distance w.r.t the center of the workspace)?
- Are these neurons really representing upcoming movements? or they just happen to have an activity that matches our hypothesis (control)
