## What was it about
The workshop was about computational theory of neuronal circuits and information processing in neural networks. Considering that we are dealing with a noisy nonlinear system both spatially and temporally, this requires using power mathematical techniques. Hence, the focus of the workshop was on the inherent difficulties of studying the spatiotemporal neural circuit dynamics.

The workshop was held in Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization, Göttingen, Germany.

The workshop continued for four days. On the first day we had tutorials, conducted by the organizors, on three different topics: 
- Balanced network dynamics, 
- Quantifying chaos in neural circuits, and
- Statistical physics of learning in perceptron-based networks.

The next three days was the actual workshop where the guest speakers gave talk on their recent works. During these days I had the pleasure of talking to some of well-known researchers in the field such as Surya Ganguli, Robert Gütig, etc.

I also presented a poster in this workshop titled as "The Effect of Non-invasive Deep Brain Stimulation Using Temporal Interference: A Computational Study" On Wednesday evening. you can find the list of all the people who presented a poster <a href="http://www.wamtn.info/schedule.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

Unfortunately I left on Thursday evening and could not attend the last day (Friday).

## My Experience
Being among world-renowned researchers and talented PostDoc and PhD candidates from well-known universities all over the world, for a master student who has been introduced to this field around a year ago is a strange and amazing opportunity. I have gained a lot of new knowledge, on top of all: there is still a lot of knowledge to gain!
